Data Structures - This course emphasizes the study of the basic data structures of computer science (stacks, queues, trees, lists) and their implementations using the java language included in this study are programming techniques which use recursion, reference variables, and dynamic memory allocation. Students in this course are also introduced to various searching and sorting methods and also expected to develop an intuitive understanding of the complexity of these algorithms.


Assignment 01 - Implemented a double ended queue interface that can have many operations performed on it, including adding/removing from either side, comparing equality, dynamic resizing, and a toString().
