Data Structures - This course emphasizes the study of the basic data structures of computer science (stacks, queues, trees, lists) and their implementations using the java language included in this study are programming techniques which use recursion, reference variables, and dynamic memory allocation. Students in this course are also introduced to various searching and sorting methods and also expected to develop an intuitive understanding of the complexity of these algorithms.


Assignment 01 - Implements a double ended queue interface that can have multiple operations performed on it, including adding/removing from either side (with/without shifting), comparing equality, dynamic resizing, and a toString() method.

Assignment 02 - Implements a custom equivalent of MyStringBuilder() by turning Strings/charArrays/MyStringBuilders into a linked list. Contains methods such as toString(), append(), indexOf(), replace(), insert(), and reverse().

Assignment 03 - Implements an entirely recursive equivalent of Assignment 02/MyStringBuilder(), with all the same methods, using no loops whatsoever.

Assignment 04 - Wrote a program to test four different sorting methods (Simple Quicksort, Median of 3 Quicksort, Random Pivot Quicksort, and MergeSort) with various array sizes (25k, 50k, 100k, 200k, 400k, 800k, 1.6m & 3.2m) and various data setups (random, sorted, and reverse sorted). Program automatically averages ten trials for each combination of sort/size/data setup and transcribes the results into a .txt file. Includes an excel spreadsheet with respective speeds and a brief write-up.
