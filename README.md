# CS0445

Assignment 01 - Implements a double ended queue interface that can have multiple operations performed on it, including adding/removing from either side (with/without shifting), comparing equality, dynamic resizing, and a toString() method.

Assignment 02 - Implements a custom equivalent of MyStringBuilder() by turning Strings/charArrays/MyStringBuilders into a linked list. Contains methods such as toString(), append(), indexOf(), replace(), insert(), and reverse().

Assignment 03 - Implements an entirely recursive equivalent of Assignment 02/MyStringBuilder(), with all the same methods, using no loops whatsoever.

Assignment 04 - Wrote a program to test four different sorting methods (Simple Quicksort, Median of 3 Quicksort, Random Pivot Quicksort, and MergeSort) with various array sizes (25k, 50k, 100k, 200k, 400k, 800k, 1.6m & 3.2m) and various data setups (random, sorted, and reverse sorted). Program automatically averages ten trials for each combination of sort/size/data setup and transcribes the results into a .txt file. Includes an excel spreadsheet with respective speeds and a brief write-up.
